Overview :
The Stock Market Predictor is a Streamlit web application that allows users to input a stock symbol and view historical stock data along with predicted future prices. The application uses a pre-trained neural network model, historical stock prices, and moving averages to generate predictions.

Requirement :

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
yfinance
Keras
Streamlit
Matplotlib
scikit-learn

Code Analysis :

The code comprises the following key components:

Loading a pre-trained neural network model using Keras.
Fetching historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).
Preprocessing the data, including scaling and creating input sequences for the model.
Displaying historical stock data, 44-day moving averages, and 44-day vs. 100-day moving averages using Matplotlib and Streamlit.
Generating stock price predictions using the trained neural network and visualizing the results.
